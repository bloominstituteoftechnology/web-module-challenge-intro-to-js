/*
When doing these tasks, we recommend using console.log to test the output of your code to make sure it works correctly.
This will usually entail console logging the answer directly or console logging the invocation (call) of the function so when it
returns a value, that value will be logged to the console.  An example of this would be:  console.log(theFunction(value1,value2))

//Dog feeder - Depending on their weight and age, we need to know how many pounds of food to feed our dog each day!
/*
Use the hungryDog function and feeding requirements below to do the following:
  1. Invoke the hungryDog function below and pass it a weight value in pounds
  2. Also, pass to hungryDog an age value in years (note: if the dog is a puppy, the age will be a decimal. For example: three months = 3/12 or .25)
  3. Do the proper calculations and return the number of pounds of raw food to feed the dog/puppy in a day
  
  REMEMBER: This program should handle correctly adult AND puppy ages and weights
  
  Feeding Requirements:

  Adult Dogs 1 year and older 
     up to 5 lbs - 5% of their body weight
     6 - 10 lbs - 4% of their body weight 
     11 - 15 lbs - 3% of their body weight 
     > 15lbs - 2% of their body weight 

  Puppies less than 1 year
     2 - 4 months 10% of their body weight
     4 - 7 months 5% of their body weight 
     7 - 12 months 4% of their body weight
    
  NOTE: If done correctly, a weight of 15 lbs and age of 1 year would return 0.44999999999999996
