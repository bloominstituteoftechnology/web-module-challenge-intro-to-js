This will usually entail console logging the answer directly or console logging the invocation (call) of the function so when it
returns a value, that value will be logged to the console.  An example of this would be:  console.log(theFunction(value1,value2))

REMEMBER: This program should handle correctly adult AND puppy ages and weights

Feeding Requirements:

Adult Dogs 1 year and older

Puppies less than 1 year

   4 - 7 months 5% of their body weight 
   7 - 12 months 4% of their body weight

Use the game function below to do the following:
1. Receive 2 parameters the user's choice and the computer's choice
2. Return whether the user won, lost, or tied based on these rules of the game described below - the strings returned need to match the strings below exactly.
 - win should return "you win!"
 - lose should return "you lose!"
 - tie should return "it's a tie"
