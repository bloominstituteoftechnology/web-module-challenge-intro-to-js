//Dog feeder - Depending on their weight and age, we need to know how many pounds of food to feed our dog each day!
/*
Use the hungryDog function and feeding requirements below to do the following:
1. Invoke the hungryDog function below and pass it a weight value in pounds, followed by an age value in years
2. 🌟 NOTE: if the dog is a puppy, the age will be a decimal (rounded to two places). For example: 3 months = .25 (3 divided by 12)
3. Do the proper calculations and return the number of pounds of raw food to feed the dog/puppy in a day

REMEMBER: This program should handle correctly adult AND puppy ages and weights
HINT: Remember that the order in which we pass in our arguments matters when it comes to parameters

Feeding Requirements:

Adult Dogs 1 year and older 
   up to 5 lbs - 5% of their body weight
   6 - 10 lbs - 4% of their body weight 
   11 - 15 lbs - 3% of their body weight 
   > 15lbs - 2% of their body weight 

Puppies less than 1 year
   2 - 4 months 10% of their body weight
   4 - 7 months 5% of their body weight 
   7 - 12 months 4% of their body weight
  
NOTE: If done correctly, a weight of 15 lbs and age of 1 year would return 0.44999999999999996
NOTE 2: This is a great time to check the tests to see what it expects, versus what is actually 
        returned from your function. This is an example of the output to look for on each test point. 
          ● hungryDogFunction › Dog is 1 year and is 5lbs or less

            expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

            Expected: 0.2
            Received: undefined

              21 | describe('hungryDogFunction', ()=>{ 
              22 |   it('Dog is 1 year and is 5lbs or less', ()=>{
            > 23 |     expect(functions.hungryDog(4, 1)).toBe(0.2);
                |
          ^
              24 |   })
      
        Notice the expected and received, expected is what the test is looking for, and received is what was actually returned from this function. You can also see it's passing in two values, the number 4 and the number 1. 
        So, on this one test, the weight would be 4 pounds, and the age would be 1 years old. It's expecting your function to return a decimal number of 0.2

2. Return whether the user won, lost, or tied based on these rules of the game described below - the strings returned need to match these strings below exactly.
 - win should return "you win!"
 - lose should return "you lose!"
 - tie should return "it's a tie"
