//Dog feeder - Depending on their weight and age, we need to know how many pounds of food to feed our dog each day!
/*
Use the hungryDog function and feeding requirements below to do the following:
  1. Invoke the hungryDog function below and pass a weight value in pounds to it
  2. Pass to hungryDog an age value in years as well (note: if the dog is a puppy, the age will be a decimal. For example: three months = 3/12 or .25)
  3. Do the proper calculations and return and console log the number of pounds of raw food to feed in a day
  
  REMEMBER: This program should calculate correctly adult AND puppy ages and weights.  Also you can console log the invocation of hungryDog to see the answer.
  
  Feeding Requirements:

  Adult Dogs 1 year and older 
     up to 5 lbs - 5% of their body weight
     6 - 10 lbs - 4% of their body weight 
     11 - 15 lbs - 3% of their body weight 
     > 15lbs - 2% of their body weight 

  Puppies less than 1 year
     2 - 4 months 10% of their body weight
     4 - 7 months 5% of their body weight 
     7 - 12 months 4% of their body weight
    
  NOTE: If done correctly, a weight of 15 lbs and age of 1 year would return 0.44999999999999996
